For DS 340 Intro to Machine Learning & AI. As a final project, we were given a general prompt of using neural networks in some capacity to solve a use-case. Because of my passion for the space sciences, I knew I wanted to do something astronomical, and my partner, Derek Roberts, agreed. We began thinking about classifying astronomical objects. For example, determining the image of a star compared to a nebula, galaxy, asteroid, etc. With this general idea, we decided to compare how models would classify these when they were trained on a set of images that included AI-generated content, as well as models trained purely on AI-generated photos.
